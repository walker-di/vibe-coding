# Todo List for REST API Transformation and Refactoring

How to work with this todo list:
Execute one task at a time.
Update this file.
If you finished the implemnentio,
Run the project and test it using the browser
Update this file with the bugs you found.
Start the loop from the beginning( no need to ask. just do it).

- [ ] Verify that all endpoints return the expected responses

### 4.2 Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation to reflect the new REST conventions
- [ ] Document the standardized response format

## 5. Implementation Plan

### 5.1 Phase 1: Create Utility Functions
- [x] Implement response formatting utilities
- [x] Implement error handling utilities
- [x] Implement parameter validation utilities

### 5.2 Phase 2: Refactor Core APIs
- [x] Refactor Clips API
- [x] Refactor Stories API
- [x] Refactor Scenes API

### 5.3 Phase 3: Refactor Supporting APIs
- [ ] Refactor Creatives API
- [ ] Refactor Products API
- [ ] Refactor Personas API
- [ ] Refactor Themes API
- [ ] Refactor Upload API

### 5.4 Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test all refactored endpoints
- [ ] Verify that all functionality is maintained
- [ ] Update documentation

## 6. Iterative Testing and Debugging

### 6.1 Application Testing
- [x] Run the project after completing the refactoring tasks
- [x] Navigate through all major features and functionality
- [x] Document any bugs or issues encountered
  - Found issue with theme relation in Creatives API - temporarily removed theme relation from queries

### 6.2 Bug Fixing
- [x] Prioritize and fix identified bugs
  - Fixed issue with theme relation in Creatives API by temporarily removing theme relation from queries
  - Fixed issue with Stories API returning 500 error when fetching stories by creativeId
  - Fixed issue with API utility functions by creating a dedicated api-utils.ts file
- [x] Retest fixed functionality to ensure issues are resolved
  - Verified that Creatives API endpoints now work correctly
  - Verified that Stories API endpoints now work correctly
- [x] Update documentation as needed

### 6.3 Regression Testing
- [x] Perform regression testing on all fixed issues
  - Tested Creatives API endpoints
  - Tested Stories API endpoints
- [x] Verify that fixes don't introduce new problems
  - No new issues found during testing
- [x] Document any remaining issues or edge cases
  - There's still a warning about "Creative 5's persona (5) has mismatching productId (undefined) compared to route productId (3). Links might be incorrect." - this is likely a data consistency issue that needs to be addressed in a future task
  - There are some accessibility warnings in the StoryList component that should be addressed in a future task
  - Fixed issue with story pages not displaying data correctly due to API response format changes
  - Fixed issue with SceneEditor component not properly handling clip selection and duplication
  - Fixed issue with clip selection navigating to a new page instead of showing the clip in the canvas editor
  - Removed fade transitions from the CanvasEditor component for smoother clip switching
  - Fixed infinite loop issues in the SceneEditor and CanvasEditor components
  - Fixed issue with canvas not saving data and updating the preview image
  - Fixed issue with clip preview not updating after editing
  - Fixed errors when loading invalid canvas data

### 6.4 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Identify any performance bottlenecks in the refactored code
- [ ] Optimize database queries and API responses
- [ ] Measure and document performance improvements

## 7. Post-Transformation Testing and Debugging Cycle

### 7.1 Initial Project Setup and Testing
- [ ] Run the project with `npm run dev`
- [ ] Navigate through all major features and functionality
- [ ] Document all bugs and issues encountered
- [ ] Categorize bugs by severity and affected functionality

### 7.2 First Debugging Iteration
- [ ] Address high-priority bugs identified in initial testing
- [ ] Fix UI/UX issues in the main user flows
- [ ] Test fixes to ensure they resolve the identified issues
- [ ] Update the bug list, removing fixed items and adding any newly discovered issues

### 7.3 Second Debugging Iteration
- [ ] Address medium-priority bugs from the updated list
- [ ] Focus on functionality issues in secondary features
- [ ] Test fixes thoroughly across different scenarios
- [ ] Update the bug list again with current status

### 7.4 Third Debugging Iteration
- [ ] Address remaining bugs and edge cases
