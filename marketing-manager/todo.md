# Todo List for REST API Transformation and Refactoring

How to work with this todo list:
Execute one task at a time.
Update this file.
If you finished the implemnentio,
Run the project and test it using the browser
Update this file with the bugs you found.
Start the loop from the beginning( no need to ask. just do it).


## 1. REST API Standardization

### 1.2 Standardize HTTP Status Codes
- [x] Use appropriate HTTP status codes consistently across all endpoints:
  - 200: OK (successful GET, PUT, DELETE)

  - 400: Bad Request (validation errors)
  - 404: Not Found
  - 500: Internal Server Error

### 1.3 Standardize Error Handling
- [x] Create a centralized error handling utility
- [x] Implement consistent error handling across all endpoints
- [x] Use SvelteKit's `error()` helper consistently

## 2. API Endpoint Refactoring

- [x] Standardize response format and error handling

## 3. Code Simplification and Refactoring

### 3.1 Create Utility Functions
- [x] Create a utility function for parameter validation (e.g., ID parsing)
- [x] Create a utility function for standardized JSON responses
- [x] Create a utility function for database error handling

### 3.2 Simplify Database Operations

## 4. Testing and Documentation

### 4.1 API Testing
- [ ] Create test cases for all refactored endpoints
- [ ] Verify that all endpoints return the expected responses

### 4.2 Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation to reflect the new REST conventions
- [ ] Document the standardized response format

## 5. Implementation Plan

### 5.1 Phase 1: Create Utility Functions
- [x] Implement response formatting utilities
- [x] Implement error handling utilities
- [x] Implement parameter validation utilities

### 5.2 Phase 2: Refactor Core APIs
- [x] Refactor Clips API
- [x] Refactor Stories API
- [x] Refactor Scenes API

### 5.3 Phase 3: Refactor Supporting APIs
- [ ] Refactor Creatives API
- [ ] Refactor Products API
- [ ] Refactor Personas API
- [ ] Refactor Themes API
- [ ] Refactor Upload API

### 5.4 Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test all refactored endpoints
- [ ] Verify that all functionality is maintained
- [ ] Update documentation

## 6. Iterative Testing and Debugging

### 6.1 Application Testing
- [ ] Run the project after completing the refactoring tasks
- [ ] Navigate through all major features and functionality
- [ ] Document any bugs or issues encountered

### 6.2 Bug Fixing
- [ ] Prioritize and fix identified bugs
- [ ] Retest fixed functionality to ensure issues are resolved
- [ ] Update documentation as needed

### 6.3 Regression Testing
- [ ] Perform regression testing on all fixed issues
- [ ] Verify that fixes don't introduce new problems
- [ ] Document any remaining issues or edge cases

### 6.4 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Identify any performance bottlenecks in the refactored code
- [ ] Optimize database queries and API responses
- [ ] Measure and document performance improvements

## 7. Post-Transformation Testing and Debugging Cycle

### 7.1 Initial Project Setup and Testing
- [ ] Run the project with `npm run dev`
- [ ] Navigate through all major features and functionality
- [ ] Document all bugs and issues encountered
- [ ] Categorize bugs by severity and affected functionality

### 7.2 First Debugging Iteration
- [ ] Address high-priority bugs identified in initial testing
- [ ] Fix UI/UX issues in the main user flows
- [ ] Test fixes to ensure they resolve the identified issues
- [ ] Update the bug list, removing fixed items and adding any newly discovered issues     

### 7.3 Second Debugging Iteration
- [ ] Address medium-priority bugs from the updated list
- [ ] Focus on functionality issues in secondary features
- [ ] Test fixes thoroughly across different scenarios
- [ ] Update the bug list again with current status

### 7.4 Third Debugging Iteration
- [ ] Address remaining bugs and edge cases
- [ ] Perform cross-browser and responsive design testing
- [ ] Fix any compatibility issues identified
- [ ] Update the bug list with final status

### 7.5 Final Verification
