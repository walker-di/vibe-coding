## 1. REST API Standardization

### 1.1 Standardize API Response Format
- [ ] Create a consistent response format for all API endpoints
  - Success responses: `{ data: <result>, message: <optional message> }`
  - Error responses: `{ error: <error message>, details: <optional details> }`

### 1.2 Standardize HTTP Status Codes
- [ ] Use appropriate HTTP status codes consistently across all endpoints:
  - 200: OK (successful GET, PUT, DELETE)
  - 201: Created (successful POST)
  - 400: Bad Request (validation errors)
  - 404: Not Found
  - 500: Internal Server Error

### 1.3 Standardize Error Handling
- [ ] Create a centralized error handling utility
- [ ] Implement consistent error handling across all endpoints
- [ ] Use SvelteKit's `error()` helper consistently

## 2. API Endpoint Refactoring

### 2.1 Clips API
- [ ] Refactor `/api/clips/[id]` endpoints to use named exports (GET, PUT, DELETE)
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types for all parameters and responses
- [ ] Standardize error handling and response format

### 2.2 Stories API
- [ ] Refactor `/api/stories` and `/api/stories/[id]` endpoints to use named exports
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types for all parameters and responses
- [ ] Standardize error handling and response format

### 2.3 Scenes API
- [ ] Refactor `/api/scenes` and `/api/scenes/[id]` endpoints to use named exports
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types for all parameters and responses
- [ ] Standardize error handling and response format

### 2.4 Creatives API
- [ ] Ensure all `/api/creatives` endpoints follow REST conventions
- [ ] Standardize response format and error handling

### 2.5 Products API
- [ ] Ensure all `/api/products` endpoints follow REST conventions
- [ ] Standardize response format and error handling

### 2.6 Personas API
- [ ] Ensure all `/api/personas` endpoints follow REST conventions
- [ ] Standardize response format and error handling

### 2.7 Themes API
- [ ] Ensure all `/api/themes` endpoints follow REST conventions
- [ ] Standardize response format and error handling

### 2.8 Upload API
- [ ] Refactor `/api/upload/clip-preview` and `/api/upload/template-preview` to follow REST conventions
- [ ] Standardize response format and error handling

## 3. Code Simplification and Refactoring

### 3.1 Create Utility Functions
- [ ] Create a utility function for parameter validation (e.g., ID parsing)
- [ ] Create a utility function for standardized JSON responses
- [ ] Create a utility function for database error handling

### 3.2 Simplify Database Operations
- [ ] Create reusable database query functions for common operations
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for database operations

### 3.3 Validation Refactoring
- [ ] Centralize validation schemas for reuse across endpoints
- [ ] Implement consistent validation error handling

### 3.4 Type Safety Improvements
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript types for all request and response objects
- [ ] Use type-safe database operations

## 4. Testing and Documentation

### 4.1 API Testing
- [ ] Create test cases for all refactored endpoints
- [ ] Verify that all endpoints return the expected responses

### 4.2 Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation to reflect the new REST conventions
- [ ] Document the standardized response format

## 5. Implementation Plan

### 5.1 Phase 1: Create Utility Functions
- [ ] Implement response formatting utilities
- [ ] Implement error handling utilities
- [ ] Implement parameter validation utilities

### 5.2 Phase 2: Refactor Core APIs
- [ ] Refactor Clips API
- [ ] Refactor Stories API
- [ ] Refactor Scenes API

### 5.3 Phase 3: Refactor Supporting APIs
- [ ] Refactor Creatives API
- [ ] Refactor Products API
- [ ] Refactor Personas API
- [ ] Refactor Themes API
- [ ] Refactor Upload API

### 5.4 Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test all refactored endpoints
- [ ] Verify that all functionality is maintained
- [ ] Update documentation

## 6. Iterative Testing and Debugging

### 6.1 Application Testing
- [ ] Run the project after completing the refactoring tasks
- [ ] Navigate through all major features and functionality
- [ ] Document any bugs or issues encountered

### 6.2 Bug Fixing
- [ ] Prioritize and fix identified bugs
- [ ] Retest fixed functionality to ensure issues are resolved
- [ ] Update documentation as needed

### 6.3 Regression Testing
- [ ] Perform regression testing on all fixed issues
- [ ] Verify that fixes don't introduce new problems
- [ ] Document any remaining issues or edge cases

### 6.4 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Identify any performance bottlenecks in the refactored code
- [ ] Optimize database queries and API responses
- [ ] Measure and document performance improvements

## 7. Post-Transformation Testing and Debugging Cycle

### 7.1 Initial Project Setup and Testing
- [ ] Run the project with `npm run dev`
- [ ] Navigate through all major features and functionality
- [ ] Document all bugs and issues encountered
- [ ] Categorize bugs by severity and affected functionality

### 7.2 First Debugging Iteration
- [ ] Address high-priority bugs identified in initial testing
- [ ] Fix UI/UX issues in the main user flows
- [ ] Test fixes to ensure they resolve the identified issues
- [ ] Update the bug list, removing fixed items and adding any newly discovered issues

### 7.3 Second Debugging Iteration
- [ ] Address medium-priority bugs from the updated list
- [ ] Focus on functionality issues in secondary features
- [ ] Test fixes thoroughly across different scenarios
- [ ] Update the bug list again with current status

### 7.4 Third Debugging Iteration
- [ ] Address remaining bugs and edge cases
- [ ] Perform cross-browser and responsive design testing
- [ ] Fix any compatibility issues identified
- [ ] Update the bug list with final status

### 7.5 Final Verification
- [ ] Perform a complete walkthrough of all application features
- [ ] Verify that all identified bugs have been resolved
- [ ] Document any remaining minor issues for future iterations
- [ ] Create a summary report of the debugging process and outcomes

### 7.6 Continuous Improvement
- [ ] Establish a process for ongoing bug tracking and resolution
- [ ] Implement automated testing for critical functionality
- [ ] Create a plan for regular maintenance and updates
- [ ] Document lessons learned for future development cycles
