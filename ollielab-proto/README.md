**Project Overview**

OLLIELAB is a mobile application that allows users to capture physical energy/activities (referred to as "Energy in Motion" or EOT), transform these captures into digital art, mint the art as NFTs, and potentially sell these NFTs. It integrates with Google for authentication and seems to involve a payment process (PIX) for NFT sales.

**5. Web3 / Blockchain Considerations**

*   **Blockchain Network:** Choose a suitable blockchain (e.g., Polygon, Flow, Solana, Celo, or even a layer 2 on Ethereum like Optimism/Arbitrum) based on transaction costs, speed, and developer ecosystem. Polygon or Flow are often good choices for apps targeting wider user adoption due to lower fees.
*   **Smart Contracts:**
    *   An ERC-721 or ERC-1155 compliant NFT contract. This contract will handle the minting and ownership tracking.
    *   Potentially a simple Marketplace contract if complex on-chain selling logic is needed, but a simpler off-chain sales process (like shown in the flow with email delivery) can be implemented first.
*   **Minting Process:** The backend will interact with the chosen blockchain network to mint the NFT via the smart contract. This requires a blockchain node (e.g., via Infura, Alchemy, or running your own) and managing a wallet/private key on the backend (carefully secured!) or integrating with user wallets (more complex UX for mobile). Given the "Disponibilizar" flow via email, server-side minting seems more likely initially.
*   **Metadata Storage:** NFT metadata (name, description, image URL, EOT link/data, attributes) should be stored on decentralized storage like IPFS or Arweave. The `metadata_url` in the `nfts` table would point to this decentralized resource. The actual video/art files (video_url, image_url) should also ideally be stored on decentralized storage and referenced in the metadata.
*   **Gas Fees:** Determine who pays for the minting transaction gas fees. The user? The platform? If the platform pays, budget for this.
*   **Digital Asset Delivery:** The flow shows delivery via email. This likely means sending the buyer a link or instructions on how to access the NFT (e.g., view on a marketplace, transfer to their wallet). If using server-side minting, the platform would transfer ownership to the buyer's wallet after payment confirmation. If using client-side minting (user connects wallet), the user would already own it, and the email confirms payment and perhaps provides sale details. The "Disponibilizar" likely means facilitating the transfer and sending confirmation.

**6. Technical Stack Recommendations**

*   **Mobile App:** React Native or Flutter for cross-platform development, or native Kotlin (Android) / Swift (iOS) for performance/platform-specific features. React Native/Flutter are often faster for initial development.
*   **Backend:** Node.js (Express/NestJS), Python (Django/Flask), Ruby on Rails, or similar web framework. Choose based on team expertise. Node.js is often chosen with React Native.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL or MySQL are solid choices.
*   **File Storage:** AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or similar object storage for video and image files. For NFT assets/metadata, integrate with IPFS/Arweave via a service or library.
*   **AI Art API:** Integrate with a third-party service like OpenAI (DALL-E), Stability AI, Midjourney API (if available), or similar.
*   **Payment Gateway:** Integrate with a local provider supporting PIX (e.g., Mercado Pago, PagSeguro, or direct PIX API integration with a bank or financial institution).
*   **Blockchain Interaction:** Use libraries like Ethers.js (Ethereum/EVM chains), Web3.js, Flow-js, Solana-web3.js, etc. Use services like Infura, Alchemy, or Pocket Network for node access.
*   **Email Service:** SendGrid, AWS SES, Mailgun, etc.

**7. Implementation Phases (High-Level)**

1.  **Phase 1: Core Capture & Management**
    *   Setup project infrastructure (Backend, DB, File Storage).
    *   Implement Google Authentication.
    *   Develop Energy Capture (Video recording, metadata input, saving EOTs).
    *   Implement EOT Listing, Viewing (Replay), Editing, Deleting.
    *   Basic User Profile view.
    *   Deploy backend API and connect mobile app.

2.  **Phase 2: AI Art & Minting**
    *   Integrate with AI Art Generation API.
    *   Develop Gerar Arte input and preview screens.
    *   Implement backend logic for sending requests to AI API and handling responses.
    *   Research and choose a blockchain network and smart contract strategy.
    *   Develop NFT Smart Contract (ERC-721/1155).
    *   Implement NFT Minting logic (backend interaction with blockchain).
    *   Integrate with IPFS/Arweave for metadata/asset storage.
    *   Develop NFT Minting confirmation flow in the app.

3.  **Phase 3: NFT Management & Sales**
    *   Develop NFT Listing screens (Owned/Sold).
    *   Implement backend logic to fetch and display NFTs.
    *   Develop NFT Sales flow (Listing for sale, Pagamento screen).
    *   Integrate with Payment Gateway for PIX.
    *   Implement backend logic to handle payment confirmations.
    *   Implement Digital Asset Delivery mechanism (e.g., automated transfer + email).
    *   Develop success messages for sales/delivery.

4.  **Phase 4: Refinement & Production**
    *   Implement Configuration screen (if needed).
    *   Add error handling and edge case management.
    *   Implement robust security measures (API, database, wallet management).
    *   Performance optimization (video processing, API calls).
    *   Thorough testing (unit, integration, end-to-end).
    *   Prepare for deployment to app stores (Apple App Store, Google Play Store).
    *   Set up monitoring and logging.

This plan provides a solid foundation. Each section (API Endpoints, Database Schema) will require detailed design within the chosen technical stack, and the Web3 integration specifically needs careful consideration regarding key management, gas fees, and user experience complexity. Good luck!
