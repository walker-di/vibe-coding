# Enhanced Training Course System Documentation

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

The Enhanced Training Course System is a comprehensive personnel development feature that allows players to enroll personnel in training courses to gain new skills and improve efficiency. The system features real-time individual progress tracking, game speed synchronization, and project creation capabilities.

## âœ… Key Features

### Real-Time Individual Progress Tracking
- **Individual Timers**: Each personnel has separate countdown timers
- **Live Updates**: Progress updates every 100ms for smooth visual feedback
- **Progress Bars**: Visual progress bars with percentage completion
- **Completion Feedback**: Progress bars turn green with "âœ… Completed!" when finished

### Game Speed Synchronization
- **Speed Multipliers**: Respects all game speed settings (0.5x to 5x)
- **Dynamic Updates**: Existing course progress updates immediately when speed changes
- **Consistent Timing**: Course duration scales properly with game speed

### Seconds-Based Duration System
- **Engaging Progression**: Courses use seconds (180s-360s) instead of weeks
- **Real-Time Countdown**: Remaining time displays in readable format (e.g., "2m 30s")
- **Immediate Feedback**: Players see progress happening in real-time

### Progress Management
- **Reset on Exit**: Personnel who leave courses early lose all progress
- **Pause/Resume**: Course progress properly pauses and resumes with game state
- **Individual Tracking**: Each personnel maintains separate progress state

## ðŸš€ Project Creation System

### New Skills for Project Creation
- **web-development**: Enables creating website projects
- **app-development**: Enables creating mobile app projects
- **project-creation**: General project creation capability

### Context Menu Integration
Personnel with appropriate skills can create projects via right-click:
- **Create Website**: Available for personnel with web-development or project-creation skills
- **Create App**: Available for personnel with app-development, mobile development, or project-creation skills

### Project Types
- **Website Project**: Creates a product node with responsive design and user interface features
- **Mobile App Project**: Creates a product node with mobile interface and cross-platform features

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Game Engine Integration
- **Real-Time Processing**: Course progress updates every second with game speed multipliers
- **Individual Progress Tracking**: Each personnel has separate `courseProgress` object
- **Automatic Completion**: Personnel automatically complete courses when countdown reaches zero

### InfoPanel Enhancements
- **Wider Layout**: Increased from 320px to 384px for better content display
- **Responsive Height**: Uses up to 90% of viewport height to minimize scrollbars
- **Real-Time Updates**: Updates every 100ms when not paused
- **Visual Feedback**: Progress bars, completion indicators, and remaining time display

### State Management
- **Game Speed Sync**: InfoPanel calculations use game speed from store
- **Pause Awareness**: Progress freezes when game is paused
- **State Synchronization**: Both game engine and InfoPanel use identical calculation logic

## ðŸŽ¯ User Experience

### Course Enrollment Process
1. Purchase a course from the shop
2. Drag personnel into the course node (compound drag-and-drop)
3. Personnel automatically start their individual countdown
4. Monitor progress in real-time via InfoPanel
5. Personnel automatically gain skills and efficiency upon completion

### Visual Feedback
- **Progress Bars**: Fill up smoothly as time progresses
- **Color Changes**: Blue during progress, green when completed
- **Text Updates**: "2m 30s left" â†’ "1m 45s left" â†’ "âœ… Done!"
- **Completion Indicators**: Clear visual and text feedback when courses finish

### Game Speed Integration
- **1x Speed**: Courses take exact duration (e.g., 180s = 3 minutes)
- **2x Speed**: Courses take half time (e.g., 180s = 1.5 minutes)
- **0.5x Speed**: Courses take double time (e.g., 180s = 6 minutes)
