# ProductGraphTycoon - Game Concept

ProductGraphTycoon is a business simulation game where players build and manage a product development company using an interactive node-based graph interface. The game combines strategic business management with visual graph manipulation mechanics.

## Core Gameplay

### Node-Based Business Management
- **Interactive Graph Interface**: All business entities are represented as nodes in a visual graph (Personnel, Products, Tasks, Resources, Markets, Ideas)
- **Drag-and-Drop Interactions**: Players combine nodes by dragging them together to create relationships and trigger business actions
- **Real-Time Simulation**: The business operates in real-time with a tick-based system, allowing players to pause and adjust strategy

### Business Entity Types
- **Personnel Nodes**: Employees with skills, efficiency ratings, and salaries
- **Product Nodes**: Items being developed with quality metrics and feature sets
- **Task Nodes**: Work assignments that require specific skills and resources
- **Resource Nodes**: Capital, materials, and tools needed for operations
- **Market Nodes**: Customer segments with demand patterns and competition levels
- **Idea Nodes**: Concepts that can be developed into products or improvements

## Game Mechanics

### Personnel Management
- **Hiring**: Recruit employees with different skill sets and salary requirements
- **Skill Matching**: Assign personnel to tasks that match their expertise for optimal efficiency
