# ProductGraphTycoon - Current Implementation Status

## 🎯 Project Overview

ProductGraphTycoon is a business simulation game built with Svelte 5, featuring a graph-based interface for managing company resources, personnel, and products. The game combines Cytoscape.js for interactive node visualization with a Stacklands-inspired shop interface.

  - **InfoPanel**: Node details display
  - **ContextMenu**: Right-click actions
  - **Shop**: Purchase interface
  - **Timer**: **NEW** Progress bar UI showing week progression (0-100%)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with responsive design

### 5. Action Points System
- **Status**: ✅ Newly Implemented and Working
- **Features**:
  - Each personnel starts with 3/3 action points per week
  - Action points consumed when clicking personnel nodes (1 point per click)
  - Visual display on personnel nodes with lightning bolt emoji (⚡ 3/3)
  - Automatic restoration every week (120 seconds)
  - Prevents over-consumption with validation and error messages
  - Real-time updates in UI when action points change

### 6. Timer & Progress System
- **Status**: ✅ Newly Implemented and Working
- **Features**:
  - Week-based progression (1 week = 120 seconds at 1x speed)
  - Real-time progress bar showing completion percentage (0-100%)
  - Week counter display (月目001, 月目002, etc.)
  - Speed-responsive timing (adjusts duration with game speed)
  - Immediate tick triggering when progress reaches 100%
  - Smooth visual transitions and no progress stacking
  - Pause-aware timing system that maintains progress during pauses

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Cytoscape Configuration
```javascript
{
  wheelSensitivity: 1.0,  // 5x faster than default (0.2)
  minZoom: 0.1,
  maxZoom: 5,
  layout: 'cose',         // Organic node positioning
  userZoomingEnabled: true,
  userPanningEnabled: true
}
```

### Shop Card Design
- **Dimensions**: Fixed 64x64px for consistency
- **Layout**: Flex with minimal gaps (gap-1)
- **Typography**: Compact text (text-xs) and icons (text-sm)
- **Cost Display**: k-format (3k, 4k) for space efficiency
- **Interaction**: Hover effects and disabled states

### State Management Flow
1. **GameEngine** maintains canonical game state
2. **GameStore** (Svelte) subscribes to engine events
3. **UI Components** react to store changes via runes
4. **CytoscapeGraph** updates via $effect rune
5. **Shop** dispatches purchase actions to engine

## 🎮 Current Game State

### Initial Setup
- **Starting Capital**: $50,000
- **Initial Nodes**:
  - Founder (Personnel, blue circle with ⚡ 3/3 action points)
  - Initial Capital (Resource, purple rectangle)
  - Mobile App Idea (Idea, cyan star)
- **Game Speed**: 1x (configurable 0.5x to 5x)
- **Week**: Starts at 月目001 with 0% progress

### Available Actions
- **Purchase Items**: From shop interface (costs capital)
- **Personnel Interaction**: Click personnel to consume action points (1 point per click)
- **Node Interaction**: Click to select, right-click for context menu
- **Graph Navigation**: Pan, zoom, drag nodes
- **Game Control**: Pause/resume, speed adjustment (maintains progress)
- **Time Management**: Watch progress bar fill over 120 seconds per week

### Game Mechanics
- **Action Points**: Each personnel gets 3 points per week, consumed by interactions
- **Week Progression**: 120 seconds per week at 1x speed, adjustable with speed controls
- **Financial**: Capital decreases with purchases and salary payments
- **Personnel**: Founder starts with full action points, new hires get 3/3 points

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### Implemented
- **Intelligent Element Diffing**: Only update changed nodes/edges
- **Reactive Updates**: Svelte 5 runes for efficient re-rendering
- **Optimized Zoom**: Fast scroll sensitivity for smooth navigation
- **Minimal Re-layouts**: Layout only runs when new nodes added

### Considerations for Scale
- Current implementation handles small to medium graphs well
- For larger graphs (100+ nodes), consider virtualization
- Batch updates for multiple simultaneous changes
