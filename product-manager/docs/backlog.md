## Notes & Assumptions

### Team Composition
- **Dev Lead**: 1 person (project setup, architecture, deployment)
- **Frontend Dev**: 1 person (Svelte components, Cytoscape integration, UI/UX)
- **Backend Dev**: 1 person (game engine, business logic, data structures)
- **QA/Dev**: 0.5 person (testing, can be shared responsibility)

### Story Points Scale
- **1 SP**: 1-2 hours
- **2 SP**: 2-4 hours  
- **3 SP**: 4-8 hours
- **4 SP**: 1-1.5 days
- **5 SP**: 1.5-2 days

### Dependencies
- Sprint 2 depends on Sprint 1 foundation
- Sprint 3 depends on Sprint 2 components
- Sprint 4 builds on Sprint 3 mechanics
- Sprint 5 requires completed features from previous sprints

### Risk Mitigation
- **Cytoscape Integration Complexity**: Allocated extra time in Sprint 2 for learning curve
- **State Management Complexity**: Dedicated tasks for bridging engine and UI state
- **Performance Concerns**: Dedicated optimization sprint (Sprint 5)

This backlog provides a structured approach to building your ProductGraphTycoon game, with clear deliverables and dependencies mapped out across 5 two-week sprints.
